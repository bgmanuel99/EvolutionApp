### EVOLUTION APP

The app uses a genetic algorithm to calculate the best characteristics of the species and prove them in different environments to see which off the individuals feet the best in each one. This process tries to imitate the darwinism natural selection which stipulate that the species that adapt the best to the environment are the ones that survive.
